				<p>The wedding reception is being held at The Island Guest House bed &amp; breakfast, and the bridal party along with immediate family will be staying there Friday the 16th through Sunday the 18th.</p>
				<p>Since the venue itself has limited space, we have reserved room blocks for the rest of our guests at two other nearby hotels, <strong>The Engleside Inn</strong> and <strong>Coral Seas Oceanfront Motel</strong>. Both hotels are within walking distance, only a few blocks from the venue. When booking a room, please mention that you are attending Lisa Schmidt and Bill Dami's wedding, to get one of our reserved rooms.</p>

				<h3>Other Options</h3>
				<p>For guests that are unable to stay two nights or want a more affordable option, we recommend the <strong>Drifting Sands</strong> hotel in Ship Bottom, Long Beach Island. However, we were not able to reserve a block of rooms at this location, so guests are urged to reserve their room as soon as possible, as they are going fast. Also note that the Driting Sands hotel is about 7 miles from the wedding venue (about a 15 min drive in normal island traffic), so you will need to take a car to and from the venue if you stay there.</p>
